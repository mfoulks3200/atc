# Crafts

A **craft** is the fundamental unit of work in ATC. Each craft represents a single discrete change to the codebase, tied one-to-one with a git branch.

## Aviation Analogy

In aviation, an aircraft carries cargo from one airport to another along a planned route. In ATC, a craft carries a code change from creation to merge, following a flight plan of ordered milestones.

## Properties

| Property       | Type                               | Description                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Callsign       | `string`                           | Unique, immutable identifier for the craft                           |
| Created At     | `Date`                             | Timestamp when the craft entered the Taxiing phase                   |
| Branch         | `string`                           | The git branch associated with this craft (1:1)                      |
| Cargo          | `string`                           | Description of the change and its scope                              |
| Category       | `string`                           | Type of change — determines pilot eligibility (project-configurable) |
| Captain        | `Pilot`                            | The pilot-in-command; exactly one per craft                          |
| First Officers | `readonly Pilot[]`                 | Zero or more certified co-pilots                                     |
| Jumpseaters    | `readonly Pilot[]`                 | Zero or more observers (no code modification)                        |
| Flight Plan    | `FlightPlan` (`readonly Vector[]`) | Ordered sequence of milestones to complete                           |
| Black Box      | `readonly BlackBoxEntry[]`         | Append-only event log                                                |
| Controls       | `ControlState`                     | Who can currently modify code                                        |
| Status         | `CraftStatus`                      | Current lifecycle state                                              |

## Rules

- **RULE-CRAFT-1:** Every craft must have a unique callsign that never changes after creation.
- **RULE-CRAFT-2:** Every craft is associated with exactly one git branch. One branch, one craft.
- **RULE-CRAFT-3:** Every craft must have a cargo description assigned at creation — you can't fly without knowing what you're carrying.
- **RULE-CRAFT-4:** Every craft must have a category assigned at creation, which determines which pilots are certified to fly it.
- **RULE-CRAFT-5:** Every craft must have exactly one captain at all times. No craft flies without a pilot-in-command.
- **RULE-CRAFT-6:** Every craft records a creation timestamp when it enters the Taxiing phase.

## Example

```
Craft:
  Callsign: fix-rate-limiter
  Branch: fix/rate-limiter-bypass
  Cargo: "Fix rate limiter bypass when X-Forwarded-For header contains multiple IPs"
  Category: Backend Engineering
  Captain: pilot-bravo
  First Officers: [pilot-charlie]
  Jumpseaters: [pilot-delta]
  Status: InFlight
```
